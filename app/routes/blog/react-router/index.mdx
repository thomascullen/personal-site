React router is a package that I use in almost all of my projects. Not too long
ago, Michael Jackson
[tweeted this](https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1223684745755684864). This
made me curious as to how difficult it would be to rebuild react router from
scratch.

Before we dig into this I want to clarify that if you need a router in your
project you should just use react router. It has a lot more features, handles a
lot more edge cases and is incredibly well tested. This is purely a learning
exercise.

In this post we are going to build a simplified version of react-router that is
based on the
[newer v6 API's](https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-router-v6-pre/).

At the heart of react router is another package called 'history'. This package
is responsible for managing the router history. For this post we are only
concerned about creating a router for the web and so we are going to bake this
directly into our react components. The first thing we are going to need is a
root `Router` component and a context for our other components to consume. Let's
start with the context.

Our router is going to be much more simplified than react router in that we
aren't going to provide support for location state, hashes and other cases that
react router provides. Our router context is going to provide 2 keys; location
and push:

- location is simply a string of the current path.
- push is a function which can be called to change the current path.

And with that we can create our basic router context.

```jsx
const RouterContext = React.createContext({
  location: "",
  push: () => {},
});
```

This context is useless without rendering a provider. We are going to do that
inside of our main `Router` component. The responsibility of this component is
to provide information about the current route and provide ways to manipulate
it. We are going to store the current location path in react state. This way
when we update the location our component will re-render. We also need to
provide the `push` function to our context which will simply update the browser
location and update our location state. Finally we also listen for the window
'popstate' event to update our location when using the browser navigation
buttons.

```jsx
function Router({ children }) {
  const [location, setLocation] = React.useState(window.location.pathname);

  const handlePush = useCallback((newLocation) => {
    window.history.pushState({}, "", newLocation);
    setLocation(newLocation);
  }, []);

  const handleHashChange = useCallback(() => {
    setLocation(window.location.pathname);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener("popstate", handleHashChange);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("popstate", handleHashChange);
  }, [handleHashChange]);

  const value = useMemo(() => {
    return { location, push: handlePush };
  }, [location, handlePush]);

  return (
    <RouterContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</RouterContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

In order to test our component we are going to need a way to update the current
route to check the correct components are rendering. Let's create a `Link`
component for this. Our link component will simply take a `to` argument of the
new path and call our `push` function from the router context when clicked.

```jsx
function Link({ to, children }) {
  const { push } = React.useContext(RouterContext);

  function handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    push(to);
  }

  return (
    <a href={to} onClick={handleClick}>
      {children}
    </a>
  );
}
```

Now that we have a way to navigate around, we need a way to actually render some
routes! Let's create a `Routes` and `Route` component to handle this. Let's
start with the `Route` component because all it needs to do is simply render the
children we give it.

```jsx
function Route({ children }) {
  return children;
}
```

Next we need our `Routes` component. Here we need to iterate through the route
components and find one that matches the current location. We will also want to
render the matched route inside of a route context, so that our route children
can access any params that matched in the path. Let's start by creating the
functions we need to match the routes. The first thing we need is a function
that takes the path prop on a route and converts it into a regex that we can use
to match against the current location.

```jsx
function compilePath(path) {
  const keys = [];

  path = path.replace(/:(\w+)/g, (_, key) => {
    keys.push(key);
    return "([^\\/]+)";
  });

  const source = `^(${path})`;

  const regex = new RegExp(source, "i");
  return { regex, keys };
}
```

This will also give us an array of any keys that represet any params in the path
pattern.

```js
compilePath("/posts/:id");
// => { regex: /^(/posts/([^\/]+))/i, keys: ["id"] }
```

Next up we need a new function that will iterate through each child route and
use the `compilePath` function to test if it matches the current location, while
also extracing any matching params.

```jsx
function matchRoutes(children, location) {
  const matches = [];

  React.Children.forEach(children, (route) => {
    const { regex, keys } = compilePath(route.props.path);
    const match = location.match(regex);

    if (match) {
      const params = match.slice(2);
      matches.push({
        route: route.props.children,
        params: keys.reduce((collection, param, index) => {
          collection[param] = params[index];
          return collection;
        }, {}),
      });
    }
  });

  return matches[0];
}
```

Finally we can create a new `RouteContext` and put together our Routes
component. We'll pass the provided children into the `matchRoutes` function to
find a matching route and render it inside of a provider for the route context.

```jsx
const RouteContext = React.createContext({
  params: {},
});

function Routes({ children }) {
  const { location } = useContext(RouterContext);
  const match = useMemo(() => matchRoutes(children, location), [
    children,
    location,
  ]);

  const value = useMemo(() => {
    return { params: match.params };
  }, [match]);

  // if no routes matched then render null
  if (!match) return null;

  return (
    <RouteContext.Provider value={value}>{match.route}</RouteContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

At this point we actually have a functioning router, however, we are missing a
small but crucial piece. Every good router needs a way to extract parameters
from the URL. Thanks to our `RouteContext` we can easily create a `useParams`
hook that our routes can use to extract this.

```jsx
function useParams() {
  return useContext(RouteContext).params;
}
```

And with all of that we have our own basic working version of react router!

```jsx
function Products() {
  return (
    <>
      <h4>Example Products</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/products/1">Product One</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/products/2">Product Two</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

function Product() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return (
    <>
      <h4>Viewing product {id}</h4>
      <Link to="/">Back to all products</Link>
    </>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/products/:id">
          <Product />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/">
          <Products />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}
```
